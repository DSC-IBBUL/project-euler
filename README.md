# Project Euler

## What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

## Providing a Solution
- Create a file on this directory with name `problem-[ID}` where *[ID]* can be 1 through 50 and your programming language extensinon e.g. *problem-1.py*
- Add the codes for that problem in the language of choice ðŸ˜€ - we'll like to see various solutions in various languages.
- You can push to the master branch, kindly create a Pull Request for that, if you need to be added to this repo as a contributor - Kindly open a ticket [here](https://github.com/DSCBUK/project-euler/issues)
