## Naming Scheme

Please name your solution files in the following format - "problem??? - NAME.xxx", where the ??? is a placeholder for the number of the problem,
, NAME stands for the username of the contributor (you!), and the xxx stands for the file extension. Place this file in the appropriately named
solution folder, or create one if one does not exist.

## Commenting

Comments are a programmer's friend. Please endeavour to lay out your thought processes at appropriate points, so that others viewing the solution
can understand your train of thought as well.

Thank you.
